          Anytime, anywhere, you will be alerted!
        </span>
        <br />
        <br />
        Any critical changes, you will be notified immediately. You can set up
        your team members to be alerted too.

      <p>
        <span className="bold-text">So, how can you achieve this?</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        Firstly, import all your data (desktop, web service, large databases).
        Connect to a large number of systems and databases such as Google
        Analytics, Facebook, Salesforce, Oracle, MySQL and files on Dropbox,
        Google Drive and many many more. Check
        <span className="bold-text">here</span>
        all our direct connectors!
      </p>

      <p>
        <br />
        Schedule your refresh dates and times and CiPARTHENON takes care of the
        rest. Then mix it up the way you want: you can create multiple point
        merges and data transformations, you can design your data warehouse
        yourself.
      </p>

        <br />
        The next step is to set up the dashboards the way the users need to see
        them. Regroup all your users under your account and give them different
        access rights. Sharing the analyses with them is simple and intuitive.
        You can add comments to your live dashboards and share them with your
        colleagues or clients in a few clicks.
